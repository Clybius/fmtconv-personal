ss_h and ss_v are log2(subsampling)
rgb_flag actually means that chroma subsampling doesn't apply.

http://www.mir.com/DMG/chroma.html

cp_* is the position of the sampling point relative to the frame
top/left border, in the plane coordinates. For reference, the border
of the frame is at 0.5 units of luma from the first luma sampling point.
I. e., the luma sampling point is at the pixel's center.
